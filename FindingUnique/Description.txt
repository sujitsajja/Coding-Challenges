Given an array of unsorted objects of some class (that implements hashCode and equals), move the distinct elements of the array to the front.
The function behaves as follows.
Let k be the number of distinct elements of A (k is not known).
Find the k distinct elements of arr[], and move them to arr[0..k-1].
Return k.
